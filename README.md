# CSE422: Artificial Intelligence

<p>Survey of concepts in artificial intelligence. Knowledge representation, search and Control techniques. AI machines and features of LISP and PROLOG languages. Problem Representation; search, constraint propagation, rule chaining, frame inheritance, inference and learning in intelligent systems; systems for general problems solving, game playing, expert consultation, concept formation and natural languages processing; recognition, understanding and translation. Use of heuristic vs. algorithmic programming; cognitive simulations - vs. machine intelligence; study of some expert systems such as robotics and understanding. Solving problems in Al languages.</p>

# Course Objectives

1. Introduce the concept of Artificial Intelligence, rationality.

2. Analyze different problem-solving strategies for informed, uninformed problems, deterministic or stochastic games, and constraint satisfaction problem.

3. Present different algorithms and the analysis of complexity, optimality and completeness of these algorithms.

4. Develop the critical skill to formulate problems and strategies to solve problems.

5. Introduce the concept of uncertain knowledge and probabilistic reasoning.

6. Introduce probabilistic and logic models so the students will be able to use these models in various decision-making problems.

7. Introduce the basic concept of machine learning.
